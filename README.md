# RNA-Seq-data-analysis

The analysis of RNA Seq data is quite straightforward. Bioconductor is a popular website providing tools for the analysis of various high-throughput data.  edgeR is a popular package that fits generalize linear model to analyze RNA seq data (count data).  Below is a simple Bioconductor article to show this with examples and codes. For our data, we start the analyses from the step 5.2.  Our goal is to look for the differentially expressed genes across 2 clusters or 3 clusters identified by the imaging features.

For your reference, below is another thorough Bioconductor article documenting all the details of analyzing RNA seq data starting from scratch.  The package is DESeq2 (another popular tool).

Here are some result figures.
